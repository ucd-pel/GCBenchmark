This repository contains 360 GC benchmarks that were generated with HERMES: An Efficient Benchmark Generation Engine for Java Garbage Collection. They are based on real-life Java applications that span a wide range of diverse GC/memory behaviours. The aim is to strengthen the evaluation of GC-related advancements. They are used in the research activities of the **Performance Engineering Laboratory** at the [School of Computer Science (University College Dublin)](https://www.cs.ucd.ie/).
